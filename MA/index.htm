            <h2>Welcome to Math Analysis</h2>
            <p>In this 12-week Math Analysis course, you will explore a comprehensive range of mathematical concepts spanning Algebra 2, Precalculus, and Differential Calculus. You will begin with function theory, learning about inverse and composite functions. Next, you will delve into polynomial and rational functions, mastering graphing, factoring, Descartes' rule of signs, and more. The course will cover exponential and logarithmic functions, focusing on their properties and real-world applications.<br/><br/>You will explore trigonometry, including graphing functions, the laws of sines and cosines, Heron's formula, and trigonometric identities. The course will then move on to polar coordinates, teaching you how to convert to polar form and graph various polar equations. You will study vectors, performing operations such as addition and subtraction, and understanding dot products and real-world applications.<br/><br/>Matrices will also be covered, including matrix operations and their applications in solving systems of equations. Conic sections, such as parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas, will be explored, focusing on their graphs and properties. The course will include series and induction, where you will learn about summation notation, arithmetic and geometric series, and mathematical induction.<br/><br/>You will also study limits and continuity, calculating limits and understanding continuity, including the intermediate value theorem. The course will cover differentiation, teaching you the formal definition, rules, and applications of derivatives. Finally, you will explore applications of differentiation, including critical points, optimization, and theorems related to differentiation.<br/><br/>By the end of this course, you will have a strong foundation in these essential mathematical concepts, preparing you for advanced studies and practical applications.<br/><br/>Recommended calculators for this course include the: <ul><li>TI-83</li><li>TI-84</li><li>TI-36X Pro</li></ul> Please only use graphing calculators in portions of the course where it is specified. The TI-36X is permitted for use throughout the entire course.<br/>If you have any questions, feel free to email me at support@pyaresquare.com.</p>
